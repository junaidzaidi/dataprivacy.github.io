<h1>Data Privacy</h1>
<p>There are no known risks of participating in this study. Any potential loss of confidentiality will be minimized by storing data in a restricted-access folder on Box.com, an encrypted, cloud-based storage system and the NORC Data Enclave, a secure data enclave managed by NORC (norc.org). The raw survey data will only be accessed by members of the research team. Your personally identifiable information will be deleted within 3 months of when you complete the survey.  If we write a report or article about this research project, your identity will be protected to the maximum extent possible.</p>
